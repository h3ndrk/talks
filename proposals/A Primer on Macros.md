# A Primer on Macros

Macros are everywhere in Rust code. From `println!()` to `#[derive(...)]`, they can be used in many powerful ways.
This talk gives an overview from user and implementation perspective over the basic concepts, macro rules, and procedural macros.
Since macros transform source code, we will also look into parsing and synthesizing code with macros.

The talk is a mix of slides and live coding.
